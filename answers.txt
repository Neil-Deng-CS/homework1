What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a centralized location in a distributed version control system, 
such as Git, where a copy of a project's codebase is stored and can be accessed by multiple 
contributors. It serves as a hub for collaboration, allowing developers to share and 
synchronize their work. Remote repositories can be hosted on services like GitHub or GitLab or 
they can be set up on a server accessible over a network. Developers can push their changes 
to the remote repository to make them available to others and pull changes from it to 
incorporate updates made by team members or other collaborators.
