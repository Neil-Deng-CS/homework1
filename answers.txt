What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge and rebase are two different ways to integrate changes from one branch 
into another in a version control system like Git, and each has its advantages and use cases.

A merge creates a new "merge commit" that combines the changes from one branch into another. 
This commit has two parent commits, representing the divergent histories of the branches being merged. 
Merging is a non-destructive operation that preserves the history of both branches, making it easy 
to track when and where changes were introduced. It's well-suited for scenarios where there is a need to 
maintain a clear history of contributions and collaborations, such as in team-based development.

Rebase is a process of moving or transplanting the entire history of one branch onto another. 
Instead of creating a new merge commit, it rewrites the commit history to appear as if the changes from 
the rebased branch were made directly on top of the target branch. This results in a linear, cleaner 
history without the clutter of merge commits. Rebasing can help simplify the history and make it easier 
to follow, but it should be used cautiously, as it can lead to conflicts and disrupt the shared history 
of a branch.

The main difference between merge and rebase lies in their impact on commit history. Merge preserves 
branch history by creating a new commit, while rebase restructures history to make it more linear.
